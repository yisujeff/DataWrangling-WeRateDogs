## Introduction
This project was part of the data wrangling section of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program and is primarily focused on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python, documented in a Jupyter Notebook (wrangle_act.ipynb). This Twitter account rates dogs with humorous commentary. The rating denominator is usually 10, however, the numerators are usually greater than 10. This aspect was not cleaned as it is part of the humor and popularity of WeRateDogs.

## Project Details
For this project, we only wanted original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Not all of the original tweets in the dataset are dog ratings and some are retweets.

Fully assessing and cleaning the entire dataset would require exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight quality issues and two tidiness issues at minimum) needed to be assessed and cleaned.

The tasks for this project were:

- Data wrangling, which consisted of:
  - Gathering data
  - Assessing data
  - Cleaning data
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing the wrangled data
- Reporting on my data analyses and visualizations (act_report.pdf)
